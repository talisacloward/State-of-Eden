# State of Eden
Childhood is Eden for an exuberant wild-child who wants things to stay always as they are in her little town of Emesford. But as the people around her grow up and apart, can she hold onto those she loves the most? When time turns girls of promise into women of expectation, is there a place for her?

_A State of Eden_ is a gentle, whimsicale story of growing older, and the people we hope grow old with us.

### Contractor Services Program

As part of Microsoft's workforce management strategy, **GitHub is transitioning to the [Contractor Services Program ](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/MyProcureWeb/SitePages/ContractorServicesProgram.aspx)(CSP)** for staff augmentation hiring and management. **This change will impact how you request and renew external staff.**

### Overview: What is CSP?

The **[Contractor Services Program](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/MyProcureWeb/SitePages/ContractorServicesProgram.aspx) (CSP)** is a workforce management solution run by **Allegis** and mandated for **Microsoft (MSFT) subsidiaries** like GitHub. It provides a centralized system for hiring, managing, and onboarding **staff augmentation external staff.**

Starting **late March 2025**, CSP will begin **contacting and enrolling GitHub's staff augmentation suppliers**, with full implementation expected on **July 01, 2025.**

### What is Staff Augmentation?

At GitHub, our staff augmentation external staff fall under two categories: 

1.  **Agency Temporary Worker:** Hired through an external agency for temporary staffing needs. 
2.  **Staff Augmentation Contractor:** Hired for a specific role or skill set within a project, contributing over time.
    - _**Note:** Project-Based Contractors are NOT considered staff augmentation. These contractors are hired to complete a **single, well-defined project** with a clear beginning and end._

Learn more in our [External Staff Policy](https://github-hr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/20213577360788-External-Staff-Policy).

|*** Important to note: Outsourced, Professional Employer Organizations (PEO), and Project-Based Contractors will not be supported by CSP.|
|---|

### What is Changing?

**Existing Process (Before CSP Implementation):**

-   Business Sponsors submit external staff hire requests/renewals via GitHub's [Procurement Repo](https://github.com/github/Procurement/).
-   Business Sponsors **choose their preferred suppliers** for external staff.

**New Bifurcated Process Post-Implementation (Starting July 01, 2025):**

GitHub's external staff hiring will now follow two separate processes, depending on the type of engagement:

| | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| **NEW** <br> 1️⃣ **Managed by CSP in MyOrder** | </li><li>Staff Augmentation Roles _(Staff Augmentation Contractors, Agency Temporary Workers)_ in CSP-Supported Countries | </li><li>CSP will oversee hiring to ensure compliance with Microsoft's workforce management strategy.</li><li>New competitive bidding model: Business Sponsors will no longer choose specific suppliers. Instead, CSP will provide a pool of candidates from multiple pre-approved suppliers.</li><li>There are instances when a Business Sponsor can be provided an exception to choose their supplier. More details on this **Exception Process** detailed below.|
|  2️⃣ **Continues Under GitHub's Existing Process in Procurement Repo** | </li><li>Non-Staff Augmentation Roles _(Outsourced, PEO, Project-Based Contractors)_</li><li>Staff Augmentation Roles in Non-CSP-Supported Countries|</li><li>**No change** - These roles will continue to be managed through GitHub's Procurement Repo, and Business Sponsors can continue reaching out and working directly with their chosen suppliers for these engagements.|

After Allegis wraps up the design phase for GitHub's CSP in May 2025, we'll provide step-by-step details on the new process.

### How Will CSP Support GitHub's Hiring?

CSP **does not** operate in all countries where GitHub hires external staff ([list of supported and unsupported countries](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rdblZ1m_L8CIqtSW7DpyVsZmYqmN7VPx/view?usp=sharing)). This creates **three categories of suppliers:**

### What is the Exception Process?

The Exception Process allows a Business Sponsor to request a specific supplier instead of using CSP's pre-approved candidate pool.

How it works:

1.  When submitting a MyOrder request for staff augmentation, Business Sponsors will have two options:

-   Standard CSP Process: Receive candidates from a pool of suppliers (default).

-   Exception Process: Request to choose a specific supplier.

3.  If requesting an exception, a PO review ticket will be created with MyOrder.

-   The Business Sponsor must provide a business justification.

-   If CSP rejects the justification, the Business Sponsor can escalate to a VP or higher for approval.

-   VP-level approval automatically grants the exception.

### When can the Exception Process be used?

After July 2025, exceptions will be granted in rare cases, such as:

1️⃣ Avoiding High Business Disruption:

-   If replacing a non-CSP supplier would cause major disruption.

-   This is expected to be rare since most In-Scope suppliers will transition into CSP.

2️⃣ Renewing Pre-CSP Hires from Split Suppliers in Non-CSP Countries:

-   The contract was established before CSP.

-   The worker is in a non-CSP-supported country.

-   The supplier is a Split supplier.

-   Renewals can continue until the 18-month limit is reached, after which the role should ideally be filled by an In-Scope worker.

|*** Important to note:  Exception Process is not required for Out-of-Scope suppliers or workers. These will continue under GitHub's existing process.|

### What's Next?

✅ New CSP Guidelines Coming in May 2025 -- We will share clear instructions on how to work with CSP.

✅ Questions? -- If you have any immediate queries, feel free to reach out to the Procurement team at [#contractor-services-program] (https://github-grid.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C08FWNR64AJ). More details will follow as we approach implementation.
