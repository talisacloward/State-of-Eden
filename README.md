# State of Eden
Childhood is Eden for an exuberant wild-child who wants things to stay always as they are in her little town of Emesford. But as the people around her grow up and apart, can she hold onto those she loves the most? When time turns girls of promise into women of expectation, is there a place for her?

_A State of Eden_ is a gentle, whimsicale story of growing older, and the people we hope grow old with us.
